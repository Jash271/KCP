Hi Grusha Jayesh ,

I hope all is well and your spring semester is off to a great start! Our
software engineering intern role is not open as we are not actively
recruiting for that role; however, we will continue to evaluate our
business needs. In the event we reopen the job posting, and an opportunity
arises that aligns with your skills, background, and experience, one of our
recruiters will reach out to you. If we cannot move forward with an
internship opportunity, that does not mean that Zoom is not the place for
you; it just means that things didn’t align at this time. Thanks again for
your interest in Zoom.

*Have 2-3 people references available.*

Early in your career, any reference who can vouch for you as a desirable
hire is good to have. References can be teachers, mentors, or bosses at
your summer job. Make sure to ask the person if they can be your reference
before listing them on any application.
This week’s pro tip:
*Research the company before interviewing.*

Learn about their business model, who’d you be working with, and how the
company treats diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging. Come prepared
with a few questions; this will help you get answers you couldn’t find and
show your genuine interest in the company.

Hi Grusha,

A Googler recently invited you to apply for the Software Engineering
Intern, MS, Summer 2023 - United States role. We carefully reviewed your
background and experience, and decided not to proceed with your application
at this time.

Although this role didn't work out, we may contact you if we come across
another opening that we think could interest you and that matches your
skills and experience.

Also, if you applied for any other roles with us recently, look for an
update on them soon.

Hi Grusha Jayesh,

Thank you for taking the time to apply to HubSpot.

We have carefully reviewed your application for the Software Engineering
Intern (Back End - Summer 2023) role, and at this time, we have decided not
to move forward with your candidacy.

Due to the volume of applications, we are unable to provide feedback at

Although we couldn’t align on a role today, there could be a future
opportunity at HubSpot that’d be perfect for you, so we will keep your
information, just in case.

Again, thank you for applying and best of luck in your search,

Californians get a better shot at admission?

Los
Angeles Times - Feb. 24, 2023
UC Irvine was one of three UC campuses with increased applications overall.
First-year applications increased to 121,074 for fall 2023 from 119,165
last year, while transfer applications dipped slightly. But the total
143,000 applications set a record for the third consecutive year. Dale
Leaman, UC Irvine executive director of undergraduate admissions, said he
was especially heartened that the drop in transfer applicants was smaller.
“I’m counting it as a win,” he said. “In talking to several community
college colleagues ... there is a recovery there in student engagement and
interest in returning back.” [Subscription required, you can request an

Health
and associate clinical professor in the division of geriatrics at the UCI
School of Medicine in Irvine, California, says that some CCRCs offer health
and wellness programs, such as nutritional counseling and fitness programs.
Taking advantage of those programs early can be beneficial for the long
term. … Tam recommends taking your time in making this big decision.
“Review and compare the different options as well as the requirements and
services provided at the different facilities and care levels. Take the
time to tour the community and meet people there and get their opinions of
the community.”

What’s more, says health psychologist Alison Holman, [professor of nursing
and psychological science], of the University of California, Irvine, in
that moment or moments of crisis, you do not think about the past or
future. All that matters is survival

… That narrow focus can wreak havoc on mental health. “[When] that present
moment is so intense that it sears into your mind … it may set up the
likelihood that you will have a hard time moving past it,” Holman says.

Keith Moore, [professor of Earth system science], an oceanographer at the
University of California, Irvine, who has worked on a number of widely used
climate models, is confident the trend will be short lived. Although he
says the paper makes a convincing case for a growing iron deficit in
phytoplankton now, Moore expects that just as the models predict, the winds
will eventually shift southward, and the phytoplankton bloom will be lusher
than ever. “What’s happening now may just be too subtle for those models to
pick up,” he says.

AP
- Feb. 23, 2023
Both [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] reports assert that data
suggests fetuses, infants and young children are susceptible to the toxic
effects of vinyl chloride. “The new version sort of is a much more tightly
summarized exposition, but I didn’t see them leaving out any specific
studies,” said Michael Kleinman, an adjunct professor of environmental and
occupational health at the University of California, Irvine. “The takeaway
is that children are, you know, a much more susceptible group.” … “All the
information is still in there,” Kleinman said. “They haven’t really changed
the final conclusions.” “I don’t think that there was anything egregious in
the way they’ve done it,” he noted.

Dear Keshav,

Thank you for your application for the Software Engineer Summer Internship

and, in some cases, a virtual interview. Please be advised that only the

Thank you for your understanding and patience. Stay safe, and we hope to
continue our traditional recruitment process soon.

Best Regards,

Hi Kunj Arvind,

Thank you for your interest in BambooHR!

We received an overwhelming response to the Software Developer - Intern
position, which makes us feel both humble and proud that so many talented
individuals (like you!) want to join our team.

Although we're grateful that you have chosen to apply with us, we are
unable to hire remote workers in your area at this time. If that ever
changes, we have your information on file and would be happy to contact
you! Also, for your information, all of our job postings have the approved
hiring states listed, so if you ever relocate to one of those areas, we'd
love to have you apply again.

Either way, just as we at BambooHR value our customers, we value our job
candidates and wish you the very best in your pursuits!

*Description:* In this talk I introduce the concepts and jargon of power
and sample size calculations such as alpha levels, power, and minimum
detectable effect sizes. I do several simple calculations manually and then
demonstrate how to replicate these calculations using Stata's -power-
commands. Next I demonstrate how to create tables and graphs for power,
sample size, and minimum detectable effect sizes for a range of values. We
will conclude with a discussion of strategies to increase statistical power.

UCI researchers discover method of using bacteria to monitor water
contamination

Although *E. coli* is infamous as a food-borne bacteria, it has long been a
workhorse in biotechnology. Now, UCI scientists led by Regina Ragan, a
professor of materials science and engineering, have demonstrated that the
bacterium can help detect heavy metal contamination
<https://zotmail.oit.uci.edu/Public/ClickMessage.aspx?LinkId=668704e0-9a1a-4203-9c55-09ca32ce3343&ZotMailId=SGc+dJWX54cc4x2g8v0SWg==>
in water with higher than 96 percent accuracy. The process, which the
researchers said can be accomplished in about 10 minutes, is the subject of
a study appearing in *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*.

New study links racism with epidemic of chronic pain in Black Americans

Kristine M. Molina, an associate professor of psychological science, has
helped produce a new study that raises awareness about the link between
chronic pain and racism
<https://zotmail.oit.uci.edu/Public/ClickMessage.aspx?LinkId=a02b222b-c166-4c71-b933-e1bbfd636330&ZotMailId=yyz2q/E4a7RinluepIg9jA==>.
Her study was published this month in the *Journal of General Internal
Medicine* with co-authors Howard Schubiner, Benita Jackson, John A.
Sturgeon, Shawnita Sealy-Jefferson, Mark A. Lumley, Jallicia Jolly and Zina
Trost. It demonstrates how systemic racism can generate or worsen chronic
pain, not only through biased medical care, but also via the brain’s
pain-danger-alarm processes.

UCI admission applications break record for third consecutive year

143,000 prospective students applied to UCI for fall 2023, setting a campus
record for the third consecutive year
<https://zotmail.oit.uci.edu/Public/ClickMessage.aspx?LinkId=39ae3fe8-9083-4683-876d-d3971c639a68&ZotMailId=zzOM2nvoTg1aqhv2MCNXJA==>
and continuing to solidify the university’s position as one of the most
desired schools in the country. It also places UCI among the top four
universities in the nation for the most freshman applications since 2015.
Reflecting the university’s commitment to serving students throughout the
state, UCI received applications from 57 of California’s 58 counties.
Additionally, UCI was – for the fifth consecutive year – the top UC choice
for first-generation, in-state students, with 45 percent of its
California-resident applications coming from those who will be the first in
their families to attend college.
UCI Health tops list of fastest growing OC hospitals

for the second straight year of double-digit growth – a 12% jump to $1.6
billion was preceded a year ago by a 14% increase. UCI Health is opening a
new clinic in Laguna Hills and is currently building a $1.3 billion for a
medical center complex on the UCI campus, while also funding new medical
programs in neurosciences, and heart and vascular treatment.

Hi Isha,

Thank you for applying for the Summer Internship, ML Engineering Intern |
Personalization Mission (US) position. There are lots of great internships
out there, and we’re honored you applied for ours.

We got a very large number of applications this year and unfortunately, we
have decided to not move further with your application for this role. Due
to the volume of applications we received, we will not be able to provide
you with any individual feedback.

Please note that if you applied for several different summer internships
with us, you will get a separate reply for each one.

Thank you once more for taking an interest in Spotify. There will be other
opportunities here, and we hope you will consider us again when they come
up!

Sincerely,
The Global Campus Recruitment Team

Democracies, we know, evolve. The most exciting democratic innovation in
recent decades has been the emergence of deliberative mini-publics (most
prominent among them citizens' assemblies), whose memberships comprise
random selections of regular citizens tasked with considering policy
issues. Ireland has been at the crest of what the OECD calls a
""deliberative wave,"" not least as shown by the significant contributions
DMPs have made to national policy debates over the legalization of abortion
(2018) and gay marriage (2015). In their influential ""manifesto,""
Mansbridge et al. (2012) write of a new phase in the study of deliberative
democracy, which has seen the emergence of ""deliberative systems,"" where
DMPs are linked in with the different parts of the political system.
Ireland has again been at the forefront here, as demonstrated by the
regularity of DMPs (five since 2012 and two more planned for this year).
DMPs are now common currency in Ireland, supported by all political parties
and across civil society. Over the last decade Ireland has seen the gradual
institutionalization of DMPs into the wider political system. But unlike
other cases (notably Belgium), this is not due to some grand design.
Consistent with Goodin's reference to accidental institutional design, the
lecture outlines the emerging ""Irish model"" that has been in part the
product of serendipity, in part path dependency. The outcome (to date)
reveals the real-world potential (and limitations) of a ""deliberative
democratic system.""

School of Medicine celebrates Black History Month

The first observance of Black History Month took place at Kent State
University in 1970, six years before it became a nationally recognized
celebration. It is fitting that such a significant aspect of modern
American culture was conceived at a public research university. As the only
public medical school in Orange County, the UCI School of Medicine aims to
embody the spirit of Black History Month by promoting academic excellence

The next event will take place on Wednesday, March 1, with a presentation
by Iryna Zenyuk. Zenyuk came to the United States at age 15 from Ukraine.
From age 5 to 28 she was a national level chess player, participating in 10
U.S. Women’s Chess Championships, representing the U.S. team in 1st World
Mind Games, Beijing, China 2008, being on the U.S. team in U.S. — China

many years.

Professor Zenyuk holds a B.S. (2008) in mechanical engineering from the New
York University Tandon School of Engineering. She continued her studies at
Carnegie Mellon University, where she earned M.S. (2011) and Ph.D. (2013)
in mechanical engineering. Her graduate work focused on fundamental
understanding of electric double layers in electrochemical
energy-conversion systems. After a postdoctoral fellowship at Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory in Electrochemical Technologies Group, Zenyuk
joined the faculty of the Mechanical Engineering Department at Tufts
University in 2015. In July 2018 she joined Department of Chemical and
Biomolecular Engineering at University of California, Irvine, where she is
also a Director of the National Fuel Cell Research Center.

At UC Irvine, Zenyuk’s group works on enabling energy solutions by
researching low-temperature hydrogen fuel-cells, Li-metal batteries and
electrolyzers. Zenyuk works on design strategy encompassing novel
materials, diagnostic tools and device-level testing.

She is a recipient of the NSF CAREER award (2017), Interpore society
Fraunhofer Award for Young Researchers (2017), Research Corporation for
Science Advancement, Scialog Fellow in Advanced Energy Storage (2017-2019),

Subject: UCI now offers Canvas-based media training program
To: Post Docs, all-Graduate Students <zotmail@uci.edu>

Dear Graduate Students and Postdocs,

Many faculty, postdocs, and graduate researchers have reached out to the
UCI Office of Strategic Communications & Public Affairs and school
communicators for help developing skills to discuss their academic
expertise to a general audience through the news media.

In response, we are offering the Canvas-based “*Media Training for
Academics, Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Spotlight*.”
It’s a free, self-paced course driven by a series of short videos and
exercises covering topics including:

   - What makes news?
   - How to identify, develop and deliver your messages for the media
   - What to do when a reporter calls
   - Preparing for on-camera interviews
   - How to write and pitch your own op-ed piece
   - How to set up professional-style video-call interviews

The UC Berkeley Office of Communications and Public Affairs created the
course and is now making it available to all UC campuses. This media
training program is organized into four topic modules, each offering
several 1- to 5-minute videos, readings and exercises, all of which are
optional and not required for advancing through the modules. Participants
can also download various tip sheets on the key topics covered.

Take your media interview skills to the next level with *“Media Training
for Academics, Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Spotlight.”*
Learn more and get a link to the course registration page on the *UCI
Communications website*

Water UCI Speaking of Water Series
Getting the Lead Out with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
<https://zotmail.oit.uci.edu/Public/ClickMessage.aspx?LinkId=f210e4ee-ec67-48d9-a6ae-f7d228769672&ZotMailId=o6UcBwduoMFag0sOdhc/hg==>
Tuesday, February 21, 2023
12 PM

The webinar will focus on NRDC’s work on the implementation of the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law particularly around lead service line
replacement, drinking water in California, and touch on NRDC’s drinking
water work in Michigan and Illinois. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a
once in a generation investment into our country’s infrastructure and an
opportunity to help states finance lead service line replacement.
Contaminated drinking water disproportionately impacts low-income
communities and communities of color and so the equitable distribution of
these federal funds will be paramount to ensuring that the health and
safety of these communities are prioritized.

We received an overwhelming response to the Software Developer - Intern

love to have you apply again.

Either way, just as we at BambooHR value our customers, we value our job
candidates and wish you the very best in your pursuits!

Best,

David Voci

at this time.

Although this role didn't work out, we may contact you if we come across
another opening that we think could interest you and that matches your
skills and experience.

Also, if you applied for any other roles with us recently, look for an

✅*Info about **Two Sigma *

I wanted to give you some more details about who Two Sigma is and what the
company is all about! Two Sigma is a New York City-based hedge fund that
uses artificial intelligence, machine learning, and distributed computing
for its trading strategies. 💻

Here are a couple of things you’d expect to see at Two Sigma:

   - *Technology & Investment.* Technology drives their business. Guided by
   the scientific method, they devise models that begin with inspired ideas or
   economic hypotheses. In a systematic, process-driven fashion, models are
   expanded, tested and integrated into their investment strategies.
   - *A Culture of Learning.* Two Sigma wants to help all of their
   employees grow and get better! As their company gets bigger, the
   opportunities for teaching, growth, and mobility multiply. They encourage
   everyone to contribute - by leading classes, study groups, or brown-bag
   lunch talks, writing for their internal blog, screening movies, or sharing
   knowledge another way.

Like I said above, preparation is *crucial *to acing your interview! Below
are a few pro tips from the RippleMatch team that will help. For a more
detailed overview of the interview process and how to prepare, read our
guide to interviewing here.

*﻿﻿**(1) Sell yourself.*

Your background is what caught their attention, so make sure that you can
speak about yourself and your accomplishments. Check out some common
interview questions here.
<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://u2545375.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=WomOBOtCwgeD1-2B-2FZb1R-2FcadEzcLsW8cC3aDUfSeZBtAOZFEq-2FEbeGw5c4GzN781ITgZmQSOOFQvIbTSiYd5fKwHRYY7FUVLGyAMQcLvSVtnehz-2BjY9HEXY3KwToLfX5cE43Akj2UD96c2bsG54tzV9srwZWSegz6z-2FyVFPYWULWw2VNA84ujQRAi5ZRcvB-2BpJnYN_0h6Ubto8U42z3xK2nzGnr-2BPZETBL45eqn0vZsBVNP6F2OKOeN-2BlYPLDoU5BbGBR0ipd03R3lrNcQ58hAFi-2FC5XlAXdUpkqm1EMs17jlWbcuGTgJ5mCo48YQd5YmNbQi6dL76yNc5iDOCidGlTBgPAtvFXGaafion8BIUteuE-2BUFkiGFS7bOpRZkslTBavlsqxUN3CSv48ijxCODVEfP4zWoyluFJki8ZZ1x-2BItysa-2B4-3D__;!!CzAuKJ42GuquVTTmVmPViYEvSg!OYwzvgJJ1o0AqcwsGJBxzx1zh7Ol6-B72Ir2hO8aHOCVI_q3q2uVyybI_Gudw-p1M8J5pT8bkXK9REni8kny$>

*(2) Be enthusiastic.*

Don't forget: enthusiasm is a good thing! Companies love to hear that you
are excited about their positions. If this is your dream job, let them know.

*(3) Do your research.*

Make sure you can articulate exactly why you would be a good fit for the
company. If you don't have much experience, make sure you convey how
interested you are in the new role. Here's an article that might help.
<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://u2545375.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=WomOBOtCwgeD1-2B-2FZb1R-2FcadEzcLsW8cC3aDUfSeZBtAOZFEq-2FEbeGw5c4GzN781IsOkvvwekhOFJXQnW5j-2BZjKPS8YwUVBx8tYXvN0B-2BeX5FNiAXjGGsGnE9ixhz2-2FFJWxrxedMdvlk66dFamcoGo3LyxwMpFAGwS09HatjjZy8-3DfKHA_0h6Ubto8U42z3xK2nzGnr-2BPZETBL45eqn0vZsBVNP6F2OKOeN-2BlYPLDoU5BbGBR0wBHp5pzFB5jl-2FSviYH7J6-2BWqr2xcQBaUQw3VZf20n4vUcNCFNucPq5rKjXSVseSiiOt-2FYiVg4Ms1lsAXwmSD-2BGyEnMYY-2BaNj43IT9wyL48RaUnuXLDsjRIltW-2BJYKG1j2r3MgAgCgHzhxMIPv5QstF5Hm4Pszt2H-2BKIeCiOyfsY-3D__;!!CzAuKJ42GuquVTTmVmPViYEvSg!OYwzvgJJ1o0AqcwsGJBxzx1zh7Ol6-B72Ir2hO8aHOCVI_q3q2uVyybI_Gudw-p1M8J5pT8bkXK9RMvKVO2W$>

*(4) Prepare thoughtful questions.*

Always prepare two or three great questions to show the recruiter that you
did your research.

*(5) Always follow up.*

Follow up with a thank you note to your interviewer within 24 hours of the
interview! Failing to write a note will hurt your chances, while a
thoughtful and reflective thank you is one of the best ways to turn a
""maybe"" into a ""yes"".

Let me know if you have any questions. We're all pulling for you!

Good luck,

Brennan

Hi Archana,

Unfortunately, eBay has decided not to move forward with your application
for Software Engineering Intern at this time. We understand that this is a
disappointing decision, but keep your head up!

Remember that persistence is key, and that it usually takes over 10
introductions to get an offer. In the meantime, we'll keep working hard to
match you with more opportunities. Every opportunity we share with you is
based on your profile and takes ~5 minutes to complete. We'll also follow
up with recruiters on your behalf to make sure you hear back quickly.

We have carefully reviewed your application for the Software Engineering

Hi Archana,

Unfortunately, Alteryx has decided not to move forward with your
application for Software Engineer Intern (Summer 2023) at this time. We
understand that this is a disappointing decision, but keep your head up!

Remember that persistence is key, and that it usually takes over 10
introductions to get an offer. In the meantime, we'll keep working hard to
match you with more opportunities. Every opportunity we share with you is
based on your profile and takes ~5 minutes to complete. We'll also follow
up with recruiters on your behalf to make sure you hear back quickly.
